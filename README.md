Hungry? New to the area? Want to eat vegetarian/vegan? Let Veg Finder help you

The "Veg Finder" app helps you find vegetarian, vegan, veg-friendly restaurants and stores near your current location without requiring you to type anything. Alternatively, you may search an address (or town or zip code) manually.
The app displays a list of eateries including their phone number and address. You may dial the restaurant directly from the app or navigate to the address on Google Maps by selecting the item of your choice.

The data is sourced from http://www.vegguide.org, a project of Compassionate Action for Animals, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. The project's mission is to encourage people to cultivate empathy for animals and move towards a plant-based diet. 

You can lend your support to this noble cause by adding your favorite vegetarian/vegan outlets directly to this website (if you don't see them listed by the Veg Finder app)

Go Veg! Be healthy!
